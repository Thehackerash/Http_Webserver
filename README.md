# Http webserver from scratch
I have build a HTTP/1.1 server that is capable of serving multiple clients, with functionality of uploading and retrieving any file from the server.

# technologies used
socket, sys, threading and argparse libraries in python. 

Along the way you'll learn about TCP servers,
[HTTP request syntax](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html),
and more.
